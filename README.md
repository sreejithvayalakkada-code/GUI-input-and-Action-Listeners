Here is the actual code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SalaryCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter hourly wage: ");
        double wage = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.print("Enter hours per week: ");
        double hours = scanner.nextDouble();
        
        double yearlySalary = wage * hours * 52;
        System.out.printf("Yearly Salary: $%.2f%n", yearlySalary);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
